Crash course - Console

allesfit your discovery transit using the python console 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*allesfitter* expects a folder with 

- all your data files (`Leonardo.csv`), 
- a settings file (`settings.csv`), and 
- a parameters file (`params.csv`). 

Then you let *allesfitter* run on that directory, and it does the rest. The GUI hides all this from you, so let's have a look behind the scenes. Open the `examples/crash_course
<https://github.com/MNGuenther/allesfitter/tree/master/examples/crash_course>`_ folder. You will see the following:

- a file `run.py`,
- a folder `allesfit_Leonardo`, and 
- a folder `allesfit_all_TMNT` (this is for later).



`run.py`

This file just contains the simple 3 lines you need to execute to run any of the examples below (after installation). For example, using Nested Sampling:
::
    import allesfitter
    allesfitter.ns_fit('allesfit_Leonardo')
    allesfitter.ns_output('allesfit_Leonardo')

Or, if you're the MCMC kind of person:
::
    import allesfitter
    allesfitter.mcmc_fit('allesfit_Leonardo')
    allesfitter.mcmc_output('allesfit_Leonardo')



`allesfit_Leonardo`: 

This folder is an example of fitting the following data set: `Leonardo.csv` (discovery photometry). Time, flux and flux error are given in a comma-separated .csv file.

`settings.csv`. Open it, and you will see that its minimal content are the planet letter ("b") and instrument ("Leonardo"). All of these must match the entries in `params.csv` and the names of any data .csv, here we only have `Leonardo.csv` files. To speed up the example, we also set the fast_fit option and run on 4 cores. There are dozens of other possible settings to give the user all freedom. These are explained further in Section X below. (todo)

`params.csv`. Open it, and you will see the parameters describing the model. There are dozens of possible parameters to freeze and fit. These are further explained in Section Y below. (todo)

Finally, when *allesfitter* runs, it creates the subfolder `results`. It contains log files, result tables, LaTex tables, plots of the inital guess and final fit, corner plots, trace plots (for Nested Sampling), chain plots (for MCMC) and an internal save file. Have a look!
