Brilliant! You got great transit parameters that allowed to schedule follow-up observations, and you are now the hero of your team! They even baked you a cake! And even better: they nicely prepared all the data for you in a folder called `allesfit_all_TMNT`:

* Leonardo.csv (discovery photometry)
* Michelangelo.csv (follow-up photometry)
* Donatello.csv (decent RV data)  
* Raphael.csv (good RV data)

Now let's allesfit all that data! Explore the `settings.csv` and `params.csv` files to see how all this additional data is included into a global fit for TMNT-1b. Next, move on to the tutorials page and learn how to tackle this new data set from scratch!
